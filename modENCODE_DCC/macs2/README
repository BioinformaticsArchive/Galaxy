###instructions for setting up macs2 on galaxy###
1. install python2.7 and numpy on all the worker nodes of your galaxy cluster
	a. this can be done manually by the user 
	b. user can run a script in the modENCODE_Galaxy directory
	   	bin/enablemacs2.pl #number_of_workers #key_file
	   	(ie. bin/enablemacs2.pl 2 zzhou_GalaxyKey.pem)
	   and follow the prompts on screen to get the requirements setup

2. the remaining dependencies for macs2 must be setup on /mnt/galaxyTools/tools
   	a. reference this wiki page: http://wiki.g2.bx.psu.edu/Admin/Config/Tool%20Dependencies
	b. checkout the directory called macs2dep from svn (should be under modENCODE_Galaxy directory in svn)
	   then go to /mnt/galaxyTools/tools and create a directory called "macs2" go into the directory
   	   then run "sudo cp -r path_to_macs2dep/2.0.10.2 ." and then run "sudo ln -s 2.0.10.2 default"

3. on the master cluster macs2 scripts must be added to the tool_config.xml in modENCODE_DCC
   and the modENCODE_Galaxy_config.pl must include the command to copy the directory over to /mnt/galaxyTools

4. once all this is done, run the config script to copy over the files and restart galaxy.
